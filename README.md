🎓 Trainer
   Impart my knowledge, experiences and practical things that I use daily on topics like #JavaScript, #TypeScript, #React, #React-Native in courses

💡 Distributed Worker
   Means 100% independent of location and only occasionally on site.
   Frequently used words in this context are also #RemoteWork #HomeOffice

ℹ️ With over 20 years of competence in creating applications, I‘m an expert at leading and developing projects for mobile and web (Apps, SPAs, API-services, etc.).

I dispose of a deep understanding of the front- and backend, the integration of different systems, the interaction, the product and the communication with stakeholders.

All this with passion, compassion and focus of people and products.
